#Online Food Ordering System

• Developed a comprehensive Online Food Ordering System using ASP.NET, integrated 
with MS SQL Server for database management. The system enables customers to 
browse a dynamic menu, select items, place orders. The project also includes an 
advanced administrative dashboard where administrators can efficiently manage 
categories, food items, user accounts, and order processing.

• Key features include user authentication, secure payment gateway integration, and 
detailed order history tracking. The database is meticulously designed to handle large 
volumes of transactions with high efficiency, ensuring data consistency and integrity. 
Additionally, implemented robust error handling and data validation mechanisms to 
enhance security and reliability.

• This project showcases strong skills in web application development, database design, 
and user interface design, with a focus on optimizing user experience and system 
reliability. It involved the use of ASP.NET architecture for better code organization and
maintenance, as well as the implementation of responsive design principles to ensure 
the application is accessible across various devices.
